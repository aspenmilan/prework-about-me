      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm currently a marketing manager for a company the manufactures workout equipment! I've worked with Shopify a little writing html and css, but that's about it!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Seattle, WA but I call Utah my home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love everything outdoors! In the winter I ski, and in the summer I love to hike, kayak, and mountain bike! I also love me some Killer Queen and Warzone. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Full Stack Web Developer. A lot of my close friends in Salt Lake City work for tech companies and they brag about how awesome their job it. They're also the smartest people I know so I'm just trying to get on their level.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Bellingham! I was living in Salt Lake City when the pandemic hit and I lost my job at a start-up so... I moved back home! </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I THOUGHT I wanted to be a mechanical engineer when I was in high school! But then I met an engineer and realised they work on some projects for over 5 years... My Favorite people are my smart nerdy friends that manage a bunch of back-end and front-end web developers. I like working on projects with a team, but I also like that things are always changing in the tech industry!</p>
